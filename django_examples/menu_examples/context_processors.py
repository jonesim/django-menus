    django-menus renders for Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 from one set of templates by emitting
    both spellings of every renamed class and data attribute. That is only worth anything if
    someone can look at both, and the useful way to look is to flip back and forth on the page
    in front of you rather than restart the server. So the choice lives in the session, and
    `?bootstrap=5` on any URL sets it:

        http://localhost:8000/?bootstrap=5

    The nav bar carries a toggle that does exactly that. `MENUS_EXAMPLE_BOOTSTRAP=5` in the
    environment, or in settings, still sets where a fresh session starts.

    Bootstrap 4 stays the default, because that is what the rest of the stack -- django-modals,
    show_src_code, crispy's template pack -- still emits. Under 5 the menus are correct and
    those libraries' markup is not, which is the point of having the switch: it shows what is
    left to do.
